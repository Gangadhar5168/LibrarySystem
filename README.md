# Library Management System

## Description
This is a simple Library Management System written in Java using basic object-oriented programming concepts. The system allows users to:

- Add books to the library
- View all books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book
- Exit the program

The project uses an `ArrayList` to store the book records and provides a console-based menu for user interaction.

## Features
1. Add a new book with ID, title, and author.
2. View the list of all books along with their availability.
3. Borrow a book using its ID. If the book is already borrowed, the user will be notified.
4. Return a book using its ID. If the book is already available, the user will be notified.
5. Exit the application safely.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- ArrayList
